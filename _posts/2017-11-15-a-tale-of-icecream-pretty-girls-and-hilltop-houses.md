<p style="text-align: justify">I know this guy whose Facebook profile (long since deleted) was a hyperlink to my childhood. Now-forgotten-but-once-best-friends; blokes I hated with every fibre of my being (and all the more forgotten for it, surprisingly); and even that girl - indelibly seared into memory as an ideal beyond anything my young imagination had ever conjured - whom I saw just once at our annual inter-school meet… they were all there in his list of friends.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Now, how this human paraquat (if I may use an insult phrased by <i>The Dude</i>) whom I, even after all these years, still feel like doing in with a brick, ever managed to get in touch with all these people, eons into adulthood, is a subject for study by far subtler minds than my own. This post isn’t about him.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">There was this day when I came across one such familiar face, a senior at school by 4 or 5 years. And as she’s very pretty, I still remember her name <i>and</i> her face, which is more than I can say for most other schoolmates of mine. Now, if you think I’m going to entertain you with some story where I made a fool of myself all those years ago, you’re in for disappointment. Four years is an unbridgeable chasm in school. She might as well have been twenty years older. This is more of a topography reminisce.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">When I cast my mind back geographically, the first images that flash through aren’t necessarily the most striking places from my childhood but simply the ones that were just by the house gate. I was never the outdoor sort.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">There was, for instance, what I always referred to as the desert cliff. It may be amongst the cornier of names but, that being what I named it, we're stuck with it for the rest of this post. I grew up in the suburbs of a port city on the Arabian Sea, on a narrow strip of land between hills and sea, tropical and rain drenched, with vegetation so thick you could walk three metres off a paved road and forget civilisation ever existed. And therefore, the most memorable place of my youth wasn’t green but brown and dusty - and all the more attractive for it. It was so shaped that the land beneath was cut off on three sides. The fourth was sealed by the walls of a few houses; almost a perfect rectangle and overgrown with weeds and wild flowers.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">To the west was the road that led to my house - also on top of the hill and southwards. On the other side of the road, the land sloped gently down. It began rocky and barren, save for a few bushes and a microwave tower. But it was a slope that went on forever, growing greener, all the way down to the end of the world, where trees battled skies. If you were standing on the desert cliff, you could see a part of all this, through a wide path between the walls of two houses; and since it lay westward, you could catch the setting sun too. Even as a kid used to sights like these, it still took my breath away.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The desert cliff has since been mowed down, and the rectangular patch has a hostel on it. The land west of the road slopes as ever before, but the setting sun no longer looks the same. The tower, once a guardian warning wayward travellers of the dark lands below, isn't as melancholy, with so many little friends around it now. It looked a lot better as a loner, though. It had character then. And purpose. But what is there now for it to warn of? Infinity has been cordoned off, civilisation having swallowed the trees and the skies. The many paths through there, those numerous shortcuts to everywhere else, most of them, they're gone. Houses everywhere. And even more walls. Sometimes, there's nothing between them; just empty walls, marking property and keeping out strangers.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">In another direction was this pond with a huge rocky face on one end. I suppose the more adventurous would dive down from there. Or maybe not - it was quite a long way down. It was big, had clean, green water, and there were grassy fields on the way there that hosted numerous football and cricket matches in the evenings. Perhaps it was on that grass that a young Tinu Yohannan honed his skills? If I were the sentimental sort, I would've cried when I was told that it had been filled to free more land.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Then there were places that are now islands in memory - that stream with two coconut trees for a bridge across it, when the jeep that took us home from kindergarten went AWOL; a bit further away were endless rolling fields of grass and flowers and not a house in sight. Where were they? I remember not! Kerala is a land in miniature. A fifteen-minute walk will take you past hills and ponds and patches of forest, but to a child each change in scenery takes an eternity - these places must have been very near where I live. I wish I had a better memory, and that I was more of the outdoor sort.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">My then best friend lived in a place which, even if I knew how to spell correctly, those of you reading would only mangle up in your mind’s voice. The shortest way to go there was a narrow, winding road, parts of it tarred, parts of it untarred, and parts of it really just a footpath cut through fields. I hated it then. It was way too long for my liking and Kerala has two seasons - one hot; the other also hot but with rains that wouldn’t let up for days. When it rained, I had to slosh through shin-deep water, pushing my bicycle along, on the path through the fields. It was rather hillier than ideal too. I had this joke, which admittedly isn’t all that funny, that the first person to discover the earth isn’t flat must have been a cyclist.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">But it was also beautiful in a way that, having been a city dweller for almost two decades now, makes it almost painful to remember. The road wound through paddy fields, a temple courtyard, kissed an unused water tank, skirted coconut trees, and even passed through an open meadow. About half-way through, there was this little shop where you could buy really cheap sweets. And further down was a fork in the road. The one on the left went up a hill, the other to my friend’s house.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">On this particular day, he was with me too, and as we came to the fork, we halted. Nine times out of ten, we’d take the road to the right. But today we were feeling philosophical. We wanted the road less travelled. We decided the path up the hill was <i>“just as fair, and having perhaps the better claim, because it was grassy and wanted wear.”</i> Besides, we could see an ice-cream cart at the gate of the house on top of the hill.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Just as we smeared the stuff all over our noses and chins, the door to the house opened and this gorgeous fifteen-year-old, whom we recognised as a senior at school walked out. I have half a mind to describe the charming little house, with its garden to the side, but truth be told, all that is left are impressions. She may have smiled or nodded at us, but we ignored her. It was way too uncool to acknowledge girls. She bought ice cream for herself and went back inside. We stood there, successfully smearing the rest of our faces with ice cream, and made no comment about her. It was uncool also to talk admiringly of girls. And then we went home.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I suppose that story sucked. Anyway…</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Until that link on Facebook, I’d forgotten all about the shortcut to my friend’s place. Maybe I’ll see if it’s still there, the next time I go home. Most likely, I’ll run into a wall somewhere. We like to build walls, don’t we? <i>“Like an old-stone savage armed.”</i> Not that I have a right to sound high and mighty. If I didn’t like to build walls myself, I’d remember more.</p>
