<p style="text-align: justify">This is what I got when I asked Mr. Christiaan Bosman of OpenHand Cafe, Leh, for something with <i>“as much meat, and as little vegetables as his conscience would allow.”</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The first bite was what soppy literature often refers to as a Perfect Moment. The lamb melted in my mouth like it were butter. Angels left their posts on Parang La, on Khardung La, and on Chang La; they swooped down to my table, forming a neat circle. As they sang hosannas, I looked up. Even though it was mid-afternoon, the skies darkened; planets aligned and the stars of the Milky Way formed a guard of honour in two neat lines above me. There was the beating of mighty wings and I was on Gabriel's shoulders, looking down, one with all the universe and all of Time.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I was there amidst swirling clouds of hydrogen as they began to condense into balls of fire; as I chewed on the lamb, I saw life take form in a primordial ocean; I was side-by-side with that first shepherd who stood on a high pass, snow crusting his hair and beard, gazing in wonder at the undiscovered valley of Ladakh; I watched Ashoka weep by the river Daya, as its waters ran red with blood; sandwich still in hand, I was comfortably seated in one of the more expensive seats when Beethoven gave the world <i>Ode to Joy</i>; I was wide awake at the stroke of the midnight hour when the tricolour broke free from its chains of imperialism and exploitation, the blue wheel at its heart in tribute to the emperor who turned away from conquest’s enduring glory; not even 80,000 Real Madrid fans could tear it from my hands and lips as Lionel Messi, battered and bloodied, <a href="https://vimeo.com/214447792">held aloft his shirt</a> in their stadium, his left foot having broken their hearts again.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">In that instant, I combined Relativity with Quantum Mechanics, the Grand Unified Theory reduced to a single, simple equation; I climbed K2 in deepest winter, from its more difficult north ridge, pausing only to rescue a snow leopard suffering from a wicked cocktail of vertigo and altitude sickness; I not only destroyed every selfie stick in existence, I erased the very concept from our collective consciousness; I brokered World Peace; my mind was a map of every misplaced key, telepathically communicating precise co-ordinates to flustered vehicle owners all across this planet and every other inhabited world.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Life will never be the same again. I will never look at a lamb the same way again.</p>
