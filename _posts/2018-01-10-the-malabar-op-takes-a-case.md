title: The Malabar Op takes a case

<p style="text-align: justify">I’d long since grown tired of what I did for a living. Of maintaining islands of Java in a teeming jungle filled with files, directories, and vicious SRP-and-DRY violations numbering in the tens of thousands. With every passing day they got a little longer, a little uglier, and a little more incomprehensible. And no one gave a damn; not even the ones who paid for them. And so, out of this desire to do something that mattered - to help people, for a few bucks a day and expenses - the Malabar Op was born.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I wanted a one-room office with my name and the legend <i>Private Eye</i> on a dirty stained-glass door. I wanted to write of long, lonely hours in a dusty office with just my phone and a bluebottle fly for company. But then, I wasn't rich. I had no savings to speak of. I couldn't afford a suitably rundown office in a suitably ramshackle building in a suitably seedy part of Delhi. And even if I did, given that my day job was in the Gurgaon of a thousand gleaming glass buildings, the commute wouldn't be pretty.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I did the next best thing. I created a page on Facebook. <i>I’m the Malabar Op. I walk the mean streets tough and unafraid... and I care. I'm here to help, to set things right. And I'm discreet. Could you “like” my page, please?</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Two weeks. The Gtalk icon on the desktop was smooth and oval and white. I had no messages, no inquiries. I wanted a girlfriend. I wanted a vacation. I wanted a home in the country. What I had was a coat, a hat, and thermal underwear.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">And then, early one Saturday morning, the doorbell rang. It was cold and wet and miserable. The sun hadn't been seen for 3 days. It rained sometimes, and there was a fog out that was as heavy and thick as the blanket that enveloped me. I should be up and about, I told myself. I shouldn't miss the few hours of relative bright, before darkness crept in at what would still be afternoon in bright, sunny Cochin. <i>“I’ve already put the garbage out. It's by the stairs,”</i> I yelled and snuggled back into my pillow. The bell rang again. I mumbled a meaningless curse, and opened the door.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Her hair might've moved gently in the wind, playing with misty tendrils of early-morning mist… had it been one of those mornings. Sadly, it wasn't; there was just the dreary stillness of the fog. That's what you get if you try and make a cinematic entrance in mid-December. I tried to look tough and unfathomable, with just the tiniest hint of reproach for the hurt of all those years ago - but tempered by a cynical, pessimistic knowledge of human nature - and also laidback, wise, and mysterious. But it's difficult to pull all that off in bad light, dressed just in thermal underwear.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<i>“It's been a while.”</i><br>
<i>“Yes.”</i><br>
<i>“Well, are you just going to stand there? I'm cold. I didn't bring my boots. All these Delhi women are wearing boots!”</i><br>
<i>“No, I... uh, won't you come in? Make yourself comfortable. I'll be right back.”</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I didn't have time for a shave or a shower, but I managed to find my coat and hat.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<i>“What on earth's the matter with you?”</i><br>
<i>“I normally do my laundry on Saturday afternoons. You caught me at a rather inconvenient time.”</i><br>
<i>“I see some slacks and t-shirts in that open cupboard over there…”</i><br>
<i>“Oh, those are deprecated.”</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I’d imagined I'd never see her again. What could she want out of me now? The years brought back memories sharp and pungent. I felt like a pig in the Rann of Kutch that had just been fired at for pork by a T-55 tank.</p>


<p style="text-align: justify">
<i>“So, I hear you're going into the bedroom-peeping business?”</i><br>
<i>“Well, it's just something I thought I'd try out. And I don't do divorce wo…”</i><br>
<i>“Right, right. How's it going?”</i><br>
<i>“…”</i><br>
<i>“I figured as much. Listen, I may have a job for you.”</i><br>
<i>“Oh?”</i> I said warily.<br>
<i>“You remember Piggy? He's been spending a lot of time with Piqué recently. He's even taking him to Arunachal, when he's going on vacation in a couple of days' time.”</i><br>
<i>“Okay…?”</i><br>
<i>“I want to know if there’s more to this than fully-compliant-with-Section-377 male bonding. Maybe you could go along with them and find out.”</i><br>
<i>“Why?”</i><br>
<i>“Let's call it a matter of the heart.”</i><br>
<i>“What do you care? You just married a vegetarian.”</i><br>
<i>“I didn't say it was a matter of <b>my</b> heart. What do you charge?”</i><br>
<i>“1250 a day and expenses, plus 12.5% VAT. 5000 bucks retainer.”</i><br>
<i>”How long would you take?“</i><br>
<i>”About two weeks.“</i><br>
<i>“How do you figure that?”</i><br>
<i>“That's all the leave I have left. Sleuthing doesn't pay the bills, yet, you know.”</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The 7 AM cold was biting. I pulled the coat tight around me. I'd slept for all of two hours and had every intention of catching up on it through the two-and-a-hour flight. That resolution lasted for all the time it took for the snowcapped line of the Himalayas, stretching unbroken across the horizon, to make its appearance - this was my first glimpse, and there would be no further sleep. The pilot pointed out Everest as we passed by, but the Himalayas are one of those ranges without bright-red labels on each peak, and I'm not sure what I think he thinks is the peak is the same as the one he thinks we think he thinks is the one.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Piggy and Piqué, who were travelling from Barcelona, landed at Guwahati airport about half an hour after I did. Piggy took one look at my bag, and asked me what the deal was. I told him: Piqué’d given me the impression that we'd have to wash our laundry by hand. Private eyes are tough, street-wise, and ruggedly charming. They're good with guns and wisecracks. But laundry is a weakness. So I'd brought along 10 sets of clothing, 2 backup sets, a towel, a backup towel, a jacket, a backup sweater, slippers, and my Jean-Pierre Melville and Jim Jarmusch collections. Piggy remarked, a tad more waspishly than was warranted, that there are, in fact, washing machines in the North East. Piqué giggled in the background. I let him have a cool, level stare.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Piggy’s cousin, Paul, picked us up from the airport. He stopped once on the way to show us the Brahmaputra. Very nice river. Dinner was at Piggy’s aunt's. She’s an exceedingly gracious host, and her daughter, a little on the quiet side, looks very much like Liv Tyler. So it might surprise that I'll be devoting blog inches not to either of them, but to Piggy’s uncle - a widely travelled man, who has apparently killed and eaten practically every species on earth.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">His favourites are pigs. He's machine gunned them in Bangladesh with an AK-47. He's rigged landmines to transform a formerly intact pig, with a family to care for, into little pieces of pork. And he's shot at them with tanks on the Indo-Pak border - prompting them to go <i>“Oink! Oink! The Pakistanis are on the other side!”</i> He even managed to get Piqué - who just 2 hours earlier had declined Paul's polite rum offering on the grounds that he'd be on an alcohol-free diet for the next 10 days - to partake of his stock of 16-year-old Fenny. 16-year-old Fenny, according to the two of them, is quite the modern miracle, as it proves that there are Goans capable of laying off a bottle of Fenny for 16 whole years.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Of course, these trivialities didn't distract me from the business at hand. I kept a close eye on Piqué and Piggy. Apart from the fact that they always seemed to want to sit together, there was, so far, nothing suspicious to report.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">We had to wake up at five the next morning to catch the bus to Tinsukia. Being on the sunrise side of India, the day starts and ends very early here. My biological clock, regrettably, does not take the reasoned approach. It says <i>pooh</i> to science, and clings to IST like things in a Fevicol ad.  If the watch says 5 AM, then irrespective of what the light-meter says, it goes into a sulk, protests against this travesty of all that’s good and holy, and drags my whole body down with it. But then, you can't really argue with bus schedules either.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Paul dropped us off at the bus-stand from where we’d catch the Volvo to Tinsukia. He’d been very kind (no force on earth could persuade me to wake up at 5:30 in the morning for someone else - but he did it with a smile); and so, when he happened to mention that he likes South Indian girls, I naturally offered to introduce him to a few if he ever found himself in South India. <i>“Why don't you start by introducing yourself to South Indian girls?”</i> muttered Piqué from the peanut gallery. I drew my hat over my eyes and went off to sleep.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Tinsukia's to the north-east of Assam, very near the border with Arunachal Pradesh. The bus journey to Tinsukia from Guwahati takes a little over 10 hours, is of singular beauty, and might just be worthy of Tolkien-type descriptions. Apparently, there are paddy fields and houses with fields of mustard and green hills and tea estates and even a stretch where rhinos can be spotted. But I'd had 6 hours of sleep the previous two nights combined and I slept right through the ride. Sorry.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">That evening, relaxing at Piggy’s mother's house with a cup of Assam tea (in Assam, they just call it <i>tea</i>), we made plans for the next day. Piggy’s brother would drive us over the border to Arunachal, to their ancestral home. This time, we'd start at the more reasonable hour of noon. That settled, we prepared for bed. Piqué asked Piggy for a foot massage. Piggy stared at him. There was a whatchamacallit in the air. I furrowed my brow and took out my notebook.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I stared grimly out the car window. We were moving slower than a glacier. If I'd wanted to get stuck in a traffic jam, no city in the world offers as much scope and variety as Delhi. I could've just stayed there and saved the bother of flying across the country. I sighed, and told Piggy that he was sitting on my coat.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">It was only when we left the traffic of Tinsukia behind that my bleak, world-weary private-eye heart began to melt. The mazy, congested streets straightened out into a highway like an arrow. The countryside opened up, the trees and the people vanished, and to the right and the left enormous fields appeared. And then, shrouded in swirling clouds ahead, the Himalayas - enigmatic and mystical. They looked so near that I thought 5 minutes more on the road would have us crashing into rock (it was, of course, a couple hundred kilometres away).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Malabar Ops are essentially men of the city, but they're loners. While the rest of the world sits around their dinner tables, sharing their stories and their jokes, while their pulp fiction gives them company, a glass of wine by the side, while they're dancing and drinking the night away, the freezing winter cold a thing of comfort and pleasure, dreaming their dreams of forever; the Malabar Op haunts the night, a man always in the now, his footsteps ringing in dark alleys behind sleazy bars, his hands deep in his coat, his breath misting up in front of him, his gait languid, but his eyes watchful. Even when he does endure the morning light and the throng of crowded markets and railway stations, it's as if he watches a film from the rows farthest. Nothing escapes his gaze, and he feels and he knows, but he does not belong.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">And so, the fields to infinity and the Himalayas ahead with their snow and their clouds, they speak to his soul. The vast expanses without anyone in sight, the ageless mountains holding promise of a land without time, ambition, or private sorrows; all of it makes the Malabar Op painfully aware that only an Arunachali may buy land there, and makes him ask his friend's mother whether she could hook him up with an Arunachali girl with plenty of land.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">We stayed in Piggy’s ancestral home in Chowkham. Stepping out of the car, I saw his uncle waiting for us - a dapper man in his 50s, with an unhurried air, a golf cap, a cigarette dangling at his lips, and a level gaze. His son Ujjal tells me that his dad was quite the terror in his younger days and that a favourite unwind for father and son is to watch <i>The Godfather</i> together in the evenings. Ujjal looks after most of the family business now, and cuts quite the cold, formidable Michael Corleone figure in his Pajero and his sunglasses. He's proud of the work his family have done over the years and when he took us around the village, pointed out all they’ve built or given land for. His grandfather, Chow Khamoon Gohain, was the first MP from the North East.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">A little after 2 in the morning, I was woken up by the howling of something horrible. It was very cold. An uneasy feeling gripped the pit of my stomach. I took out my flashlight and decided to snoop around a little. The house was old, and also rather big - made almost entirely out of wood. Snooping around in someone else's house in the wee hours of the morning demands a certain amount of stealth but, unused as I am to wooden floors, my first few steps sounded like a cautious Godzilla making for a pile of fish.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The house was shrouded in silence and darkness. I crossed the drawing room and started with the room across the passageway. The giant tusks by the idols glimmered palely. I shone my flashlight around. The room was as big as my flat in Delhi. There was nothing for me there. I turned around. Something jumped at me from the corner by the doorway. My heart leapt into my mouth and when I swallowed hard, instead of settling back inside my ribcage, it went down the wrong way. I coughed and spluttered. I walked backwards out the door and down the passageway in rather a hurry. There was nothing by the doorway that I could see except a Naga sword and a Khamti shield. I don't know why I thought something had jumped at me.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Many Arunachali houses, built as they are by the banks of rivers known to flood on occasions, are on stilts. This one was no exception. I happened to be near an entrance to the house, which meant that there was a flight of steps leading down. Walking backwards as I was, I was made very aware of its existence only on my way down, my head bouncing off wood every other step. Moving with remarkable agility (all things considered), I started to pick myself off the landing. I had my second panic attack in less than 45 seconds when I glanced up and saw a hideous face leering at me. Turned out to be the handle of a walking stick. Why would anyone want that on the handle of a walking stick?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I saw another set of steps going up in front of me. It took me into a giant room filled with all sorts of old furniture. A private eye with more talent at describing interiors might have done a good job of painting you a mental image. I caught sight of a chair that I later learnt was sat on by the Dalai Lama. Sensing a shape above me, I turned around rather slower than the last time I'd sensed a shape, and glanced upward. It was just a crafted deer head. In order to have a better look at its antlers, I tilted my hat back and took a couple of steps back. I shouldn't have. I tripped over a chest (bought from Jew Town, Cochin, and quite beautiful to look at in daylight, really), and landed with a crash on my back. Flailing about, I knocked a vase down, and cracked the leg of a stand.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I felt like I'd been mugged by the Crazy 88. But my training kicked in instantly. I listened. Not a peep. In the last 5 minutes, I’d made as much noise as a bunch of Indian close-in fielders about to get suspended by Mike Denness for excessive appealing. And yet, not a soul stirred. I decided that people who could sleep through a racket like that couldn't have that much on their consciences. I limped painfully back to bed and sleep.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">There was bamboo-shoot pork, bamboo-shoot pickle, something else that's the world's hottest chili, eggs, freshwater fish, mutton, algae, sweet potatoes, small potatoes, normal potatoes, chicken, shrimp, rice, dal, cauliflower, and lots, lots more on the lunch table. Maintaining my enviable fitness levels was clearly going to be a problem in Chowkham.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Life there is restful. The village by the riverside, the freezing waters as clean as can be, the woods and the fields with hardly a soul in sight, the Himalayas so very close by, the charm of the house itself… all of this, it sometimes makes a private eye forget that he has business at hand, and turns him into a tourist - and a vegetable of a tourist, at that.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Here in the “land of the dawn-lit mountains,” sunrise is as early as a little after 5 in the morning. The only person who can confirm that is Piqué, who’d disappear into the early-morning rain and mist to go birding. Due to a lack of witnesses, his exploits on these trips are largely shrouded in myth and mystery; but stories have filtered through of lows such as getting lost and wandering into army camps, and glorious highs such as the day he got to molest a Crested Serpent Eagle.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Aunt Frika (Piggy has as many aunts as in a Wodehouse novel, and they all ask just two things of him: that he get a haircut and get married - in that order) would regale us at the breakfast table with stories of the floods in 2004. She told us how they watched, from their terrace, house after house disappearing into the river; of how all their help had to leave to take care of their families; of how they had no water or electricity for more than a week; of how they harvested rainwater, and the joys of bathing in them.  Ujjal, sitting nearby, added gloomily that one day they too would lose their house as young rivers are rather unpredictable with their courses. After breakfast, she’d buzz off determinedly bride-hunting for Piggy (who'd sit in a corner blushing prettily).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">It was a time for the finer things in life: sleeping late, hogging like (and on) pigs, avoiding any kind of excessive physical labour, etc. We’d go orange plucking, have a look at the pagodas and the museums nearby, and buy handwoven bags  and Khamti lungis from the pretty tailor in the village. This being winter, off-roading on the riverbed in Ujjal's Gypsy was also an option. The locals were very impressed when I led local-boy Piggy across the treacherous currents of the Lohit.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The high-point was when we drove to Parashuram Kund. Legend has it that Lord Parashuram, for naughtinesses such as killing his mother, had an axe irremovably stuck to his arm. He travelled the length and breadth of the country as penance for his sin, but the axe wouldn't come off. It was only when he bathed in the waters here that it finally parted ways. This is all the more poignant to us Malabar Ops because, so the story goes, it's a blow from his axe that claimed the Malabar coast from the seas.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">It has to be true. All it takes is one glimpse to convince you that there are no sins those blue-green waters cannot cleanse. We got a couple of nice pictures, but they do no justice to the sight of the river snaking its way through those hills, the foothills of the Himalayas: sheer, green, and beautiful.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">And just when I was in danger of completely forgetting about the case, came a walk by the river. Piqué to Piggy: <i>“Come with me tomorrow morning, my little piggy, and I'll show you the eighth wonder of the world.”</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I scratched my chin thoughtfully and followed.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><i><b>“hlp! cm 2 shillong pt.”</b></i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I studied the SMS carefully. This could prove to be a new development in the case. Or it might not. But private eyes can't afford to overlook any lead, no matter how far-fetched. We know from bitter experience that things that appear unrelated at first sight tend to dovetail into the plot by page 250. I booked a cab for Shillong.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The fields that so captivated me during my ride in were now veiled by a fog tinted thickly with the orange of dusk. But I had no time for prettinesses. Wheels were turning in my head, those wheels turning other wheels, and they, in turn, working levers and complicated machinery and stuff, until wisps of smoke could be seen escaping my ears.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The cab driver, a loquacious man by Malabar Op standards (but then, who isn't?), pointed out a temple built in the centuries past by the Ahom kings. There's this tunnel, apparently, that starts beneath the temple and ends at nobody-knows-where - because no one who's ever gone in has come back out. This interested me enough to spare it a few wheels: a worthy challenge, but, on the whole, maybe more of a case for a Malabar Jones than a Malabar Op. I grunted an acknowledgment and returned to my case.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">My work in Guwahati done (I probably should've told you that I had work there and what it was and all that, but these reports have a strict word limit), I continued on my way to Shillong. Shillong's less than 100 kilometres from Guwahati, but the narrow road up through the hills is heavily plied at night by trucks, making the going a little slow in places.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The border between Assam and Meghalaya is unusual. A highway divides the two states. To the left of the highway is Assam, and to the right - lined by wine shops, the tax structure for alcohol being very attractive - is Meghalaya. And that's why Assamese chickens cross the road. For the cheaper booze.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The road up into Shillong, when not blocked by trucks, is a lonely one. The  full moon was pale yellow and had a smattering of clouds about it. The forest-covered hills were quiet in a moody, windy way. All that was left to complete the picture was for the car to break down and a wolf to start baying in the distance. But nothing of the sort happened. This isn't <i>that</i> kind of a case.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">As we neared Shillong, we crossed a big lake. I remember being very struck by it, and jotting down a description in my notebook; but as I've misplaced it, all that's left for me to say is that I was… struck by it.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">And then Shillong began. It's a city that cocks a snook at everything my textbooks ever had to say; every brick is a triumph of man against physics. Perhaps it's how all hill stations are, but this was the first big one I've seen, and it’s astonishing. Houses side by side, sometimes seemingly on top of each other, perched precariously on steep slopes, the hills swarming with pin points of light, mile after mile after mile.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">One of my pet theories is that the best way to get to know a city is to simply listen to it. The rhythms of the conversation, the language, the things left unsaid, all this, it tells you all you need to know and more. Here's what I learnt about Shillong by overhearing just one such conversation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><b>Guy 1</b>: <i>Yeah, so like I was telling you the other day, Shillong - called the Scotland of the East by the shopkeeping colonisers from long ago - is the capital of Meghalaya, which translates as “the abode of the clouds.” It's a city nestled in the Shillong Plateau.</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><b>Guy 2</b>: <i>And the reason we're waiting for a cab is that the bus service is practically non-existent. The cabs - mostly Maruti 800s, as these are vehicles with no power steering, and hence can be switched off on downward slopes to save fuel - are all shared; you can ask the driver not to pick up anyone else, though, by paying him extra.</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><b>Guy 1</b>: <i>Absolutely. Also, because it's built on hills and everything, the roads are sort of narrow, and there are many one-ways. Finding a parking spot can be a bit of a nightmare, too. But the traffic is fairly disciplined.</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><b>Guy 2</b>: <i>Hmm... We must not forget that the Khasis are one of the few matrilineal and matrilocal societies in India. For instance, most of the property passes to the youngest daughter.</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><b>Guy 1</b>: <i>Exactly. And Christianity is the dominant religion. Which is why, even though the temperature's 6 degrees right now on this Christmas day, the blood in our veins runs hot from watching all the pretty girls dressed up all nicely for church. How do they stand the cold, though, in those short dresses? Look at this guy in trench coat and hat next to us: he looks like he's auditioning for a Havells ad; I bet he has thermal underwear on too.</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><b>Guy 2</b>: <i>Interesting. This has been such a nice conversation, and informative, too, for the casual bystander. We really should meet up more often. Anyway, why I wanted to meet you today was to tell you that there's been... ooh, there's a cab!</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">At Shillong Point, I knew whom to look for. I'd deduced from the SMS that the sender was a dame in her 20s, pretty short, with medium-length straight hair. She'd most likely be a political-science teacher. I walked up and tapped her on the shoulder: <i>“It took me a while, but I'm here for you now.”</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">She stared at me expressionlessly for a moment: <i>“Well, at least this is a new one.”</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I showed her the SMS.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><i>“Are you aware that those things can also be used for purposes such as, for instance, checking whether you're the intended recipient of a fairly strange message?”</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><i>“Why would I think it wasn't intended for me? Trouble is my middle name,”</i> I replied woodenly.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">She sighed, and turned away to lean over the railing again. A little time passed. Shillong looked quite lovely from that spot, framed against the far taller hills all around it. Presently, she said</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<i>“Do you do project work?”</i><br>
I shuffled uncertainly.<br>
<i>“There's this exam I'm giving, and I'm supposed to write a 1000-word essay on Fassbinder’s Berlin Alexanderplatz. Know anything about it?”</i><br>
<i>“Oh, ah, that's not quite in my…”</i><br>
<i>“No matter. It was a long shot.”</i><br>
<i>“Is there anyone I could beat it out from?”</i> I asked hopefully.<br>
<i>“Well,”</i> she paused doubtfully, <i>“there's this guy I know who bought the Criterion edition of those discs at an Amazon sale a few months back. But he wouldn't help. He hates my guts.”</i><br>
<i>“Leave that to me. Where can I find him, and are you going to pay up front or after the job is done? I usually demand a retainer.”</i><br>
<i>“How much did you have in mind?”</i><br>
<i>“How much do you have?”</i><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">And that is how I set out to find Jeem Thar, with 14 bucks and 75 paise jangling in my pocket. I'd never worked for so little before, but she had a way of fluttering her eyes that made my knees go weak. Mind you, a man in my profession gets a lot of eye fluttering from a lot of dames; but this was easily in the top five.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I've heard claims that Shillong's the only city in India that has a paved road leading to every residence. I wouldn't know - because I didn't tail Jeem to every house in Shillong - but all the ones I did walk on were paved. I especially enjoyed tailing him on the narrower streets, my standard-issue Op boots ringing smartly on the pavement, the close walls echoing the sound in a delightful surround effect.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">And the roads were clean. There's nothing I hate more than keeping brisk pace with a suspect, and then having to hop on one foot, trying to scrape gum off. Not getting gum on his boots is vital to a private-eye - gum tends to muffle ringing footsteps, leading to low job-satisfaction levels.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Then there are the little roads that lead up and down, everywhere, that a private eye can duck into when he gets a little too enthusiastic with his footsteps and the suspect wheels sharply around. Private eyes love elevation changes. Especially when they allow him his ringing footsteps: thump, crack, thump.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The only negative was that a lot of Shillong's shops and restaurants are the small, tastefully furnished, personal types that folks go gaga over, but makes us private eyes stick out like VVS Laxman at the IPL. But that apart, the place is just private-eye heaven, I tell you.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I cornered Jeem at Ward's Lake. I'd planned to pull him under some bushes and whack the info out of him but, probably because of massive deforestation, brightly coloured umbrellas are what the young of Shillong seem to prefer. Admittedly, umbrellas look a little odd in winter, but we Malabar Ops can rough it out with what's available when forced to. I dragged him under a vacant umbrella. To the rest of the world, we were a pair of rent-crossed lovers, but only the two of us would ever know how ferocious the battle really was. After about the sixth punch on his slightly pulpy belly, he started to spill the beans. In less than 15 minutes, I had all the words anyone would ever need on <i>Berlin Alexanderplatz</i>. I made him repeat it all in German just for the hell of it.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Handing the notes over later that evening, I gruffly asked her to wipe her tears off. It was nothing, I said. Just an honest day's work. I adjusted my hat in exactly the same way that Humphrey Bogart did in <i>The Maltese Falcon</i>, wore exactly the same smirk on my face, and walked towards the waiting cab, my ringing footsteps never having sounded better.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">It was my last day there. My flight was in two hours. I hadn't yet typed out my report, but things didn't look too good for my client back in Pune. There was what you'd call an indefinable something between the two subjects that I was fairly sure I could define it in no uncertain terms.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Strangely, though, there were other emotions wrestling with my soul. Private eyes are used to dealing with the rougher elements of society. And that, in a way, defines our world view. But this case had brought me in touch with a bunch that defines hospitality: from small courtesies such as almost always speaking in English in our presence, even when they were family members meeting each other after a long time, to the not-so-small ones as rearranging their plans to the tune of several days just so we tourists could see more of the North East. I like to think of myself as cold and unsentimental, but even I found it a little difficult to say goodbye.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">And then there's this other matter: I didn't want to go back to a job where I was no more than a colour on a spreadsheet, a resource to be billed for; where the value of my work was not the code I wrote, but merely the number of hours that could be marked against my name; where a well worded and formatted email has ten times the value of a bit of programming that would make another me weep with joy; where carefully-prepared recognitions, each indistinguishable from the last, is your reward for a job that may or may not have been well done, but certainly appeared to be so to someone on a far shore.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">What meaning does <i>do it right</i> have, when what you’re judged for is <i>visibility</i>? What do you say when you're told that quality is defined only by the speed with which tasks are done, and not by any standards that mean anything to engineers; when it’s considered a job well done when you deliver what clients say they want, rather than what they really should be asking for? Could they be right, though? But if they’re right, is that how I'd want to spend the next few years of my life? Coming back to first principles, why did I once choose to become a programmer?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">While I was grappling with these thoughts, I saw Piggy and Piqué heading into a restaurant. Something about the way they held themselves told me this was a conversation I'd want to listen to. I managed to find a convenient potted plant to hide behind. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<b>Piggy</b>: <i>Dude… We've had our chance to make hay in the sack, and now is the time to… erm… let the sun… uh…</i><br>
<b>Piqué</b>: <i>Yeah. To everything, turn turn turn, there is a season. And ours is just too short. We're way different, you and I.</i><br>
<b>Piggy</b>: <i>You like animals. So do I, but only on a plate. And our views on bamboo-shoot pork are too far apart ever to be reconciled.</i><br>
<b>Piqué</b>: <i>And you’ll never have a tail as long as a nightjar, nor a plumage like that of the male paradise flycatcher.</i><br>
<b>Piggy</b>: <i>Yeah? Well, you know, that’s just like, uh, your opinion, man.</i><br>
<b>Piqué</b>: <i>Dude…</i><br>
<b>Piggy</b>: <i>Anyway, it doesn't matter. Our families would never understand and it's complicated and, in any case, you and I, we both have our responsibilities. You have a voice calling to you from the depths of the jungle, and I have... in Pune...</i><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">They turned moist eyes towards the ancient television set playing <i>Brief Encounter</i>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<b>Piqué</b>: <i>I want to die. If only I could die…</i><br>
<b>Piggy</b>: <i>If you'd die, you'd forget me. I want to be remembered.</i>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I sniffed quietly and wiped a tear off my cheek. With my other hand, I rooted about in my trench coat for a hanky. Why would anyone want to pay for international shipping to buy a David Lean set, when a private eye's life is filled with billable moments enough for a hundred films?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">But now, I had a decision to make. On the one hand was the Code I lived by. Take his Code away, and a private eye might as well become a project manager. To quote <i>Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai</i>: <i>”If one were to say in a word what the condition of being a samurai is, its basis lies first in seriously devoting one's body and soul to his master.”</i> And for us private eyes, that's the client. To lie to her, or to cover up facts in my possession, that would be unthinkable.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">And then again - as anyone who's ever called up his manager to inform him of the death of a favourite aunt on the eve of the World Cup quarterfinals knows - truth exists in several planes. From one plane, the version of the same truth on another plane can appear diametrically opposed, broadly speaking. The whole thing hinges on which plane you view it from; as a rule of thumb, it’s best to view matters from the highest plane possible, though, of course, the planes upward are never-ending, much like the way the turtles on which our flat earth balances go on and on downward.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Round and round went the same questions in my head. Johnny Caspar put it best with, <i>”I’m talkin' about friendship. I'm talkin' about character. I'm talkin' about - hell, I ain't embarrassed to use the word - I'm talkin' about ethics.”</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">For you guys, reading this stuff is an evening's entertainment. If only you knew what I was going through. I was being torn apart. Beneath my impassive exterior, I was feeling like a part-time offspinner bowling at Sehwag and unable to get his length right. And there was no one I could turn to. Whom does the strong, silent type go to with his troubles? No one can look quite like Alain Delon but I did my best imitation of <i>Le Samouraï</i> as I thought: <i>there is no solitude greater than the samurai's - or the private eye's - unless perhaps it be that of a tiger in the jungle.</i> This was something I'd have to work out for myself.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I had a soul to probe, a report to write, and expenses to claim. But, for now, I also had a flight to catch. I put my hat on as stylishly and with the same haunted expression that Gabriel Byrne had at the end of <i>Miller's Crossing</i>, and strode briskly towards the terminal.
