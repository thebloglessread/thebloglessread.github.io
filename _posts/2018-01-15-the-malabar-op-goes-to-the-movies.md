<p style="text-align: justify">I stared at the project manager’s head with vague distaste. I wasn't listening to a word he was saying. I'd heard it all before and the plot's never gripped me enough for repeat performances. What held my gaze, though, was his head: small and dark and shaped like a coconut. It had a thin covering of hair on top, very similar to and as light as the spread of coir on a de-husked coconut.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Coconuts are known for their versatility: the name Kerala, for instance, is derived from it, and even in far-away lands such as the one where they speak Malay, it's called the "tree of a thousand uses." The shell and the husk alone, since that's what brought us on to this topic, can be used to make anything from hoofbeats (a film about King Arthur and the Holy Grail, without the budget for actual horses, comes to mind), to musical instruments, to shirt buttons, to fuel. Coconut water, if drunk from the right coconut and if you believe Harry Belafonte, is good for your daughter, makes you strong as a lion because of all the iron, and is ideal with rum when you're feeling a little glum; and the white, fleshy coating on the inside, subject to the same restrictions as the liquid, tastes like a slice of heaven.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">But those are coconuts.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I snapped out of my reverie when the project manager brought up his book. I wasn’t mentioned very charitably in there, apparently. I expressed amazement at this accomplishment literary, given that the last time I checked, he couldn't put together three sentences in an email without some sort of a blooper. This terminated the interview, and I was free to go back to my desk and brood. I wanted to throw up - preferably on his keyboard. I'd just thought of an excuse to go back to his desk, and had even conjured up an imaginative segue to the barfing when, as so often happens every now and then - but usually only when I’m in the shower - the phone rang.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">A clipped, snotty voice was on the other end.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<i>“I came across this Facebook page for a private investigator… the Mallu Op or something. Are you him?”</i><br>
<i>“Yes,”</i> taking care not to betray too much interest: it helps with monetary negotiations.<br>
<i>“I’ve never seen a seedier ad.”</i><br>
I let that one fly.<br>
<i>“What do you charge?”</i><br>
<i>“One thousand o…”</i><br>
<i>“That's way too much.”</i><br>
<i>“Well, what'd you have in mind, then?”</i><br>
<i>“We'll come to that. First, can you give me any references?”</i><br>
<i>“Sorry, no. I've not been very long in the business and I do it part-time. But I've read every Hammett and Chandler ever written, and I model myself on Russell Crowe from L.A. Confidential.”</i><br>
<i>“And what do you with the other part of your time?”</i><br>
<i>“I’m a programmer.”</i>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><b>:click:</b></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The phone rang again in two days' time. She sounded a little less haughty, a little defeated.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<i>“I suppose beggars can't be choosers,”</i> she sighed. <i>“How soon can you make it to Pune?”</i><br>
<i>“As soon as you book the airline ticket,”</i> I assured her.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center">

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Ah, Pune. I knew the burg well. Yes, I did. Once. A long time ago. A sleepy burg where shops close for the afternoon and popping into a restaurant for lunch will have you popping out in four hours, if you can get the waiters to hurry up. With rich neighbourhoods, often a pleasure to walk in or drive around, and a conservative people. But that was then. This was now (or, rather, a later <i>then</i> than the first <i>then</i> there).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Despite the pouring rain, it was a little too hot for my trench coat, and I had to drape it over my arm stylishly as soon as I was out of the terminal. A black cab was waiting for me. The driver was a short, thickset grouch in his late 30s. He didn't have an umbrella, which made me regret the decision to take off the coat. Oh well, life is a sum of the choices we make. A clap of thunder, a thud of the door, a growl of the engine, and we were off.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The house was the farthest one on a little lane that leads away from all civilisation. It starts out charmingly enough, but gets woodier and has fewer houses the further you go down it. At the very end was a house all alone, as if the others on the lane were shrinking away from it. Even the pack of barking dogs running after the car stopped, as if they'd hit an invisible barrier. Trees crowded around it, but not of the sort from a Robert Frost poem; it’s undoubtedly what the forest looked like to Hansel and Gretel after the little idiots lost their trail of breadcrumbs, and probably what Red Riding Hood thought of the woods after she made her acquaintance with the wolf. So there it was, the little house at the edge of Fangorn - to careless glances as pleasant a house as anyone could hope for - and I fidgeted uneasily.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">It was a house with furniture. No, wait… that doesn't sound right. I've never managed to learn what the many kinds of furniture are, I can name about six colours, and know nothing at all of windows, curtains, and the like; so these descriptions are very difficult for me. Picture in your mind's eye a richly furnished room, but altogether on the dark side - as if light were somehow banished from there. And yet, a room that hints not at opulence or decadence, but the exact opposite - like hair done up in a bun with not a strand out of place. Done? Well, that's exactly the sort of furnishing her house had.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">A match, a scratch, a quick flame, a silhouette, and a puff of smoke. I could sense her gaze raking into me, every tiny movement and tic magnified and filed. I suppressed a nervous giggle.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<i>“So… this is what my 7000 bucks of airfare has dragged in…”</i><br>
I bristled. <i>“Look here, I got back from the North East not two weeks ago, having solved an intricate puzzle to the satisfaction of all, and I really don't need to take this kind of shit from anyone. If you don't like what you see, missy, I'm just as happy to go right back out that door.”</i><br>
<i>“And once you go right back out that door, do you walk all the way back to Delhi?”</i><br>
<i>“Ah… well… there, you see… since I'm here at your behest… it's only fair that you…”</i><br>
<i>“A blue ruby of mine has been stolen.”</i><br>
<i>“Oh, too bad. I hate it when that happens.”</i><br>
<i>“I think the thief’s going to be at the piff.”</i><br>
<i>“At the sniff, you mean?”</i><br>
<i>“What does 'at the sniff' mean, jackass?”</i><br>
<i>“Well at least all three are proper words, unlike your phrase which scores just two out of three,”</i> said I defensively.<br>
<i>“The PIFF - the <b>P</b>une <b>I</b>nternational <b>F</b>ilm <b>F</b>estival.“</i><br>
<i>“What makes you think the thief’s going to be there?”</i> I asked, interested. <i>“Have you watched Brian De Palma's Femme Fatale?”</i><br>
<i>“What? Look, I'm trying to talk as slowly and use as few syllables as possible here. I don't need fucking Bogart. All I need is a sap who'll do as he's told. On the table’s a delegate pass for the festival… which starts tomorrow, by the way. Look for a girl named Sally. Find out where she's hidden the ruby and get it back to me.”</i><br>
<i>“I don't understand. If you know who took it, why don't you just… Oh, all right. Whatever. As regards my fee…”</i> <br>
<i>“Your fee will be exactly what I choose to pay you after you retrieve my property. In the meantime, you’ll stay here.“</i>

<p style="text-align: justify">My room was on the ground floor, right next to the kitchen. The three rotis, half a bowl of dal, and the two pieces of chicken I had for dinner didn't quite sate me (private eyes as a rule work up a healthy appetite due to all the martial-arts training), and I toyed with the idea of topping up the tank, so to speak.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I crept quietly out, and was groping for a light in the passageway when two pale-yellow points of light stopped me. Now, I've come across a lot of evil in my life. I've seen everything from the polish of Hannibal Lecter, Pavanai, and Harry Lime to the malevolence of Eddie Dane and Anton Chigurh. But never have I seen anything drip evil from every pore like this dog did. I suppose zoologists would classify it as a Golden Retriever, but really, it was the size of a genetically modified lion that had been hitting the gym for 60 hours a week. It didn't make a noise… just a few leisurely steps in my direction, until it was inches from my face, mouth open, teeth gleaming and daring me to take a forward step… any step, in fact, other than back into my room.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I coughed apologetically, then remembered that he was just a dog after all, but smiled weakly anyway, all the while walking backwards gingerly, mumbled goodnight, and closed the door behind me. <i>“I can think. I can wait. I can fast,”</i> quoth Siddhartha. Well, anything he can do, I can do better.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">INOX Cinemas. The place brought back so many memories. There was a time when I used to work in the building next door. As they had limited car parking, I parked here quite a bit. For just 20 bucks a day. I glanced nostalgically around the basement.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I set about gathering information through my extensive network. I’d arranged to meet the hacker at the McDonald's nearby. How long would it take to hack into the PIFF database and get me the co-ordinates on this Sally dame?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<i>“Oh, I already know where she is.”</i><br>
<i>“You do?”</i><br>
<i>“After years of hacking, I'm now telepathically wired into the web - a flick of my neurons is all I need to get into any system.”</i><br>
<i>“Oh yeah?”</i> Private eyes don't like having the Mickey taken out of them. <i>“And?”</i><br>
<i>“She's at that table over there, wearing the delegate pass with 'Sally' printed on it.”</i><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Conversation having dwindled a fair bit anyway, I excused myself. Malabar Ops are usually pretty smooth with the ladies, but Sally seemed just a touch out of my league. I decided to wait for an opening. Which came soon enough. I'd just ambled out of the Blue Nile (not the river; it's a restaurant rather famous for chicken biryani) when I saw her arguing with a watchman.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">INOX, being a multiplex, has plenty of parking but it has rather tight entrances and exits. Sally was a new driver and, having taken out her dad's expensive car, was just a tiny bit averse to denting it. Luckily for her, dads who can afford to buy expensive cars can also usually afford memberships in expensive clubs in the middle of the city. Said club was down the road from INOX. <i>“Why don't I just park here and walk down?”</i> she wondered very reasonably.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Watchman at the club stops her just inside the entrance. Asks her for her pass. She roots around in the dashboard. Then in her bag. She tries turning her pockets inside out. No luck. Watchman tut-tuts and tells her that he couldn't possibly let her in. She could've argued with him, and told him to escort her to the reception, where they'd no doubt be able to verify her membership; but, being a pacifist, she decides to forget the whole business and risk dents at INOX.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">And this is where the story gets complex. Her car's already inside the gates, you see, which means that the easiest way to leave would be to use the <i>out</i> gate. But the out gate's further down the road, and she would have to drive through the premises to reach the exit. The watchman objects to this on the grounds that allowing a pass-lacker to drive inside the compound would be a violation of several of the club's by-laws. Which leaves her with turning the car around and leaving via the <i>in</i> gate. Except that he can’t possibly allow a car to drive <i>out</i> of it. This left them at an impasse.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The watchman eventually proposes a solution. Why don't she reverse the car out of the entrance? The by-laws have left that bit open to interpretation. Sally, though, voices reservations about backing her car out into one of the busiest streets in the locality. And there the argument rages, centred chiefly around the themes of <i>what's written in the club by-laws</i> versus <i>desire to remain out of the hospital</i>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">And in I stepped with customary Malabar Op calmness. I took the watchman aside, taking care to highlight my bulging biceps and told him, with a few words out of customary Malabar Op vocabulary, about what would happen to him if he didn't stop being a prick right about then. Sally was all gratitude, and we got talking, and I told her I was at the PIFF, too, and she asked me if I wanted to join her for a screening of <i>Galaxy Express 999</i>, Japanese anime, later in the day. It was in E-Square, a fair distance away, but she offered me a ride.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Sally was one of those new drivers for whom no obstacle is worth avoiding at less than 80 kph and with no more than 3 inches to spare. I couldn't help a few involuntary spasms through the ride, as though my foot were searching for a brake pedal on the passenger side. She's not much of a talker but had a fair bit to say on this occasion and, what was more, seemed gently reproachful. It concerned my attitude regarding the watchman. She felt I wasn't very nice to him.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<i>“Of course I wasn't very nice! He started it.”</i><br>
<i>“Well…”</i><br>
<i>“Well what?”</i><br>
<i>“He was just doing his job.”</i><br>
<i>“No, he wasn't. His job is to make sure no ones pees on the cars parked there and such like. He was just being a prick. Most likely, the sole amusement in his miserable little life is raising the hackles of those who cross his path.”</i><br>
<i>“Is that what you think?”</i><br>
<i>“That is what I know.”</i><br>
<i>“My father has this driver. I used to get annoyed with him because I felt he’s intransigent just for the heck of it. There’s one way to do everything and that’s the only way it shall be done. It took me a long time to figure out that all he’s doing is what we all aspire to - to introduce a little order and certainty into life. It isn't spite. It's just vulnerability. And you might've seen that, and you might've handled the situation differently, if you weren't so very dead sure of his motivations.”</i><br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">We were now entering the realm of the a-little-over-my-head, and I just grunted a grunt or two, and said nothing. The way I saw it, there was nothing wrong with the watchman a pile-driver or two wouldn't fix.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The movie was all right. It’s about this little boy travelling around the galaxy in a magical train that takes him from star to star in his search for the man who killed his mother. It was whizzing along, entertaining me, as movies tend to do, when towards the end, after the boy has his vengeance, the time comes for bidding farewell to his companion - the beautiful Princess Maetel - the woman he's in love with. <b><i>“From now on, I’ll be a woman who lives only in your memories. I’ll be nothing more than an illusion of a young boy's heart, a phantom of your youth.”</i></b></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">A blue light shone at my left, maybe from Sally's bag, and I felt a surge of emotion. Nothing like this had ever happened to me. And I couldn't get those damn lines out of my head. It refused to go, circling round and round in my head for weeks on end.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Just after the movie was done, I ran into Mrs Vegetarian, my last client. She recommended I watch Takeshi Kitano's <i>Boiling Point</i>. She painted a fantastic picture of glorious, nihilistic violence in poetic slo-mo, set against the brutal backdrop of the Japanese gangland. What I actually got to see was a man washing his ass in the ocean, and a display of emotional equilibrium on par with that of a 10-year-old who'd just been beaten up in a classroom fight he'd started. Confronting Mrs Vegetarian outside the hall, I demanded an explanation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><i>“You hated it? Good. I've been wanting to get back at you ever since you charged me a pot of money for 'investigating' those two idiot colleagues of mine. You told me there was nothing between them, and yet, last I heard, they'd left for Barcelona together where they're shacked up in the same apartment.”</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">She sashayed away.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The phone rang.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><i>“Dude, this is Piqué. Can you come to MG Road?”</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Half an hour later, I had an uncertain look as he extended two chicken-and-cheese rolls toward Sally and me.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><i>“I want you to try this. The best rolls in the city.”</i> He had a puppy-dog look in his eyes.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Ghosts of case files past turning up in numbers reminiscent of zombies in a George Romero flick had to mean something. There’s no such thing as coincidence.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I took the roll and munched thoughtfully. And still the princess's words refused to vacate the premises. It was all very strange.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I must've watched 20 films in those 6 days.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">There was <i>The Storm in my Heart</i>, a film about two uncompromising loners, who try to make seaworthy a rickety old boat that hasn't seen the seas for decades. Their goal is a foolhardy voyage along the Norwegian coast, to the older man's girlfriend - to reclaim a love as old as the boat itself. <i>“l travel around the world, and write about it afterwards. There are two ways to do it, you know. The easy way: when you buy plane tickets, and come home when the money's gone. And the hard way: you walk out the door, without money, without plans, away from it all.”</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Then there was <i>The Medal of Honour</i>, a Romanian film about a taciturn, crusty old man who's lived what he tells himself is a worthy life - one of honour and achievement - but he knows that no one respects him; not his wife, not his son. He gets a chance to regain some respect for himself when he's awarded a medal for the one worthwhile thing he may have done decades ago… but he barely remembers any of it, and others have different versions of that deed. Rather hard to watch, this one.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">There were a few lighter ones, too. <i>Fight, Zatoichi, Fight</i> was a no-holds-barred action flick about a blind swordsman taking care of a baby while fighting off hordes of evil henchmen with the other hand. Even a film like <i>Little Rose</i>, an underwhelming film about government persecution in Poland, had moments like this: <i>“Books are not there to be read at once. First, they are beautiful objects. Second, they are like friends.”</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">And then there was my favourite, <i>4 Minutes</i>. It begins with the camera rising high over a red-bricked prison, taking it in from a bird's eye-view - a shot sinister and beautiful at the same time. The movie's about terrible memories and sins that won't wash away. And escape through great music. What purpose is there to life, if not to fulfill our talents?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">As the week ticked closer to an end, I knew I couldn't put it off any longer. No sooner had we walked out of the final screening on the penultimate day of the festival - a screening of the Javier Bardem starrer <i>Biutiful</i> - than I reached into Sally's bag and pulled out the ruby.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
<i>“I believe this isn’t yours?”</i> I asked quietly.<br>
She didn't try to take it back… just gazed at me with infinite sadness.<br>
<i>“And is it yours?”</i><br>
<i>“I've been hired to retrieve it.”</i><br>
<i>“Do you know what it is?”</i><br>
:shrugs:<br>
<i>“It persists emotions.”</i><br>
<i>“Sorry?”</i>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">“Film-makers… storytellers… they're the best amongst us, the supreme gods. They see our world as it is and ourselves for what we are; they know how small the creator of all this must be, how limited. And since they <i>can</i> do something about it, they pour all their creativity, all their passion, into a spool of film - one that has their universe in it and that plays according to their rules; where they sculpt in time. With ideas are so powerful that they sneak past our defenses and speak directly to the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/67416-film-as-dream-film-as-music-no-art-passes-our">dark rooms of our souls</a>. Tell me something. When Maetel tells our little hero that she’ll be nothing more than an illusion of a young boy's heart, a phantom of his youth, what illusions from your own youth did you remember?”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">“I don't understand.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">“I think you do. Hard to get rid of them, yes?”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">“All right. Fine. A film got to me. Where does this thing here fit in?”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">“There's the sad part. The moment the projector's turned off and we step back out into sunlight, our world starts to take over. That ruby there can change all that. You've experienced a bit of it yourself.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">“What a load of poppycock! Disappearing into a reel is no way to live. Isn't it one of these movies of yours that had this to say: <i>’It’s these cards, and the movies and the pop songs, they're to blame for all the lies and the heartache, everything.’</i>”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">“Are they? There are mediocre films, like there are of everything else. Only a handful really speak to you. The rest… well… all they do is magnify your own lies.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">“And what if one of these that speak to you is about scooping out your neighbour's insides?”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">“So difficult for me to judge matters good and evil. Besides, there's the film, and there's you. I quit my job in the city the day after I watched <i>The Kings of the Road</i>. It spoke to me of people who live life all alone - on the road - spending years on a highway drifting between towns. Lives without meaning or shackles. And it struck me that that is the way of the world. Full of coincidences, and with no real purpose. Of brief, wondrous meetings; but also quicker farewells. We've convinced ourselves of the opposite. How unnatural is our world of unthinking allegiances - to flags, to anthems, to plans, to order, to morals, to each other? But that was me. The boy I watched it with wanted to know whether the screen had frozen up. See? There's the film, and there's you. All the ruby does is make you truer to yourself.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">“So difficult to choose between good and evil? There’s nothing easier! If you’d rather sit in a dark room and admire depravity and decadence, then it’s a culture you promote here in this world too. You, my friend, are on the side of the perpetrators, the scum.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Sally isn’t really a scoffer but she made a sound that was suspiciously like one.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">“So tell me, knight in shining armour, how many injustices did you turn your eyes away from, how many battles did you choose not to fight, in this one day, in this one city? And now, all of a sudden, it’s what our stories show that are the problem? We’re short-lived, as individuals and a species - chaos and destruction personified. We revel in darkness, in tearing each other to bits and in turning to dust everything we touch. But we have one saving grace: to look at a thing and see not what is there but what we’d like to see. To draw upon the terror encircling us, and also the serene, and use them both to paint images that are darker still and lighter still and every shade in between. I once watched a German film from the beginning of the sound era, when there were but brief snatches of dialogue. It told the story of a monster, a serial killer of children. At the end of the film, the literal silence is broken by his anguished speech, and I cried because he’d just opened a room in my soul that I hadn’t known existed. I care more about him than most people I know. Where would this fit in your neat world of rights and wrongs? I can abide everything we do to each other, all the horrors, because that’s what we are, that’s what we’ve always been. The only true crime is to order a cut or to burn a book because our ability to tell stories is our sole redemption… they’re our only creations worth a damn, and much more than what we tell each other or do to each other, they’re how your soul speaks to mine.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">“What would you have me do?”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">“Give it back to me. Your client has different views to mine. Hers is a world of responsibility and achievement and edifices of stone. People being true to themselves would destroy that world, would shatter medals and statues and name plates outside office doors. You've tasted a bit of what the ruby has to offer. It could do so much more for you… and for others.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">“Look, there are rules I live by. I can't betray a client. What use are principles, if you're going to be selective about them? You either follow them all the time, or you have none at all. I can't abide a world without a Code.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">“A code is for people without a heart. If you really cared, you'd just do what feels right.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">“I am sorry.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">As I turned and walked, I pulled my coat tight around me… and I don't remember whom I wore my hat like - or even if I wore it at all. I had to buy a new one the next day. Where could I have left it?</p>
